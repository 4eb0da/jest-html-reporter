# Contributing
So you want to contribute to the project? **How lovely!** Here are a few things to keep in mind when working with the project:

## Linting
[ESlint](https://eslint.org/) is used for style management. Make sure that your IDE recognizes the project's eslint config before you start developing.

## Testing
This project is using [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for testing and the test specifications should be placed within the _/test_ folder.
All functionality should have it's use-cases somewhat thoroughly tested (best sentence ever, thank you very much).

## Pull Requests
When you are done with your contribution, issue a pull request. The project maintainers will have a look at it as soon as possible!

## Have fun 
ðŸŽº This is the most important thing of all.
